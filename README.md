**Objective** :- 
Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report. So that, Vrinda can understand their customers and grow more sales in the next year.



Below are the key steps I followed while building this project:

**1. Data Cleaning**:- In data cleaning for a project as a data analyst, duplicates are removed, missing values are handled, and inconsistent formats are corrected. Outliers are filtered, unnecessary data is eliminated, and errors are fixed to ensure accuracy, preparing the data for analysis.

**2. Data Processing**:- In data processing, cleaned data is organized and transformed for meaningful analysis. Key calculations, aggregations, and formulas are applied to extract insights while filtering and sorting help focus on relevant information. This step ensures the data is ready for visualization and reporting.

**3. Data Analysis**:- Data analysis identifies trends and patterns by applying statistical methods and visualizations to processed data. Key insights are extracted, helping to uncover relationships, anomalies, or performance metrics. This stage provides actionable conclusions for informed decision-making.
